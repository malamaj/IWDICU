# HTML Beginner Project

This is my first web development project for ICUIWD.

I used HTML to create a structured web page that includes:
- A title in the head section
- A main heading (`<h1>`)
- A paragraph introducing HTML
- A list of essential HTML topics

Additionally, I have included examples for the following HTML concepts:
- HTML Colors: Demonstrated how to style text using inline CSS.
- HTML Comments: Showed how to insert comments that are not displayed in the browser.
- HTML Quotations: Used the `<q>` tag to format quotes.

This project was created using Visual Studio Code and will be pushed to GitHub.
